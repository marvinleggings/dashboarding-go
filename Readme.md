# Repository for a dashboarding tool in Go

This is just a place for me to experiment and get weird with software. 

Write software for no other reason than that you love it and see what happens.

Make it beautiful make it ugly make it efficient make it inefficient make it you. 

Make it for no other reason than that it is beautiful to you.

Use a language you've never used, use a language you love, use a language you hate. 

Dream big dream small go wild be free
